                Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist whose defiant patriotism made him a hero in India, but whose attempts 
                during World War II to rid India of British rule with the help of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a troubled legacy.

            <h2>Here's a time line of Netaji's life:</h2>

            <h3>Life</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Subhas Chandra Bose was born on <b>23rd January 1897</b>, in Cuttack, Orissa Division, Bengal Province, to <b>Prabhavati Dutt Bose</b>
                and <b>Janakinath Bose</b>.</li>

                <li>After his early schooling, he joined Ravenshaw Collegiate School. From there he went to join Presidency College,
                Calcutta and was expelled due to his nationalist activities. Later, he went to University of Cambridge, U.K.</li>

                <li>In <b>1919</b>, Bose headed to <b>London to give the Indian Civil Services</b> (ICS) examination and he was selected. Bose, however,
                <b>resigned</b> from Civil Services as he believed he could not side with the British.</li>

                <li>He was highly influenced by Vivekananda's teachings and considered him as his spiritual Guru. His political mentor was
                Chittaranjan Das.</li>

                <li>In 1921, Bose took over the editorship of the newspaper <b>'Forward'</b>, founded by Chittaranjan Das's Swaraj Party.</li>

                <li>He was also sent to prison in Mandalay in 1925 due to his connections with revolutionary movements where he contracted
                Tuberculosis.</li>

                <li>During the <b>mid-1930s</b> Bose travelled in Europe. He researched and wrote the first part of his book, The <b>Indian Struggle</b>,
                which covered the country’s independence movement in the years 1920–1934.</li>
                
                <li>After his return, Bose took over as the <b>elected President of Indian National Congress in 1938 (Haripur)</b> and stood for
                unqualified <b>Swaraj</b> (self-governance) and the use of force against the British which then combated against Mahatma Gandhi
                and his views.</li>
                
                <li>Bose was <b>re-elected in 1939 (Tripuri)</b> but soon <b>resigned from the presidency</b> and formed the <b>All India Forward Bloc</b>, a
                faction within the Congress which aimed at consolidating the political left.</li>
                
                <li>He died on 18th August 1945, in a plane crash in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan).</li>
            </ul>

                        <li>He actively participated in the Salt Satyagraha of 1930 and vehemently opposed the suspension of Civil Disobedience

                        <li>In the 1930s, he was closely associated with left politics in Congress along with Jawaharlal Nehru and M.N. Roy.</li>

                        <li>Because of the endeavour of the left group, the congress passed very far reaching radical <b>resolutions in Karachi in 1931</b>
                        which declared the main Congress aim as socialization of means of production besides guaranteeing fundamental rights.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                        <li>The purpose was to consolidate the political left and major support base in his home state Bengal.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><b>Civil disobedience movement:</b> When World War II began, he was again imprisoned for participation in civil disobedience 
                and was put under house arrest.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Indian Legion:</b> Bose founded the free India centre in Berlin and created the <b>Indian Legion</b> out of the Indian prisoners of
                    war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa prior to their capture by Axis forces.
                    <ul>
                        <li>In Europe, Bose sought help from Hitler and Mussolini for the liberation of India.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>In Germany, he was attached to the special bureau for India which was responsible for the broadcasting on the German
                    sponsored <b>Azad Hind Radio</b>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>On this radio, Bose on 6th July 1944, addressed Mahatma Gandhi as the <b>'Father of the Nation'</b>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><b>Indian National Army:</b> He reached Japanese-controlled Singapore from Germany in July 1943, issued from there his famous
                    call, ‘Delhi Chalo’, and announced the formation of the <b>Azad Hind Government</b> and the <b>Indian National Army</b> on 21st
                    October 1943.
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>The INA was first formed under Mohan Singh and Japanese Major Iwaichi Fujiwara and comprised Indian prisoners of war of
                        the British-Indian Army captured by Japan in the Malayan (present-day Malaysia) campaign and at Singapore.</li>
                        
                        <li>The INA included both, the Indian prisoners of war from Singapore and Indian civilians in South-East Asia. It's strength
                        grew to 50,000.</li>

                        <li>However, with the fall of Rangoon, Azad Hind Government ceased to be an effective political entity.</li>
                        
                        <li>In November 1945 a British move to put the INA men on trial immediately sparked massive demonstration all over the
                        country.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><b>Impact:</b> The I.N.A. experience created the wave of disaffection in the British Indian army during the 1945-46, which
                culminated in the great Bombay naval strike of February 1946 and was one of the most decisive reasons behind the British
                decision to make a quick withdrawal.</li>

                <li><b>Composition of I.N.A:</b> The I.N.A. was essentially non-communal, with Muslims quite prominent among its officers and
                ranks, and it also introduced the innovation of a women’s detachment named after the Rani of Jhansi.</li>
            </ul>
